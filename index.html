                                were losing weight almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan 
                                won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and

                    <li >We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but <br>
                        you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of <br>
                        electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers<br>
                         should be able to answer.

                    <ul>
                        <li >Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're <br>
                            looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, <br>
                            you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button <br>
